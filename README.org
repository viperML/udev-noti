#+TITLE: udev-noti

* About
This project aims to show desktop notifications when the user plugs in a new device or removes it. The implementation should not be complex with unnecesary features.

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# ./install.sh
#+END_SRC

or perform its actions manually

*   Attribution
This project is heavily inspired by https://github.com/dimonomid/my-udev-notify, which I found too complex for this task.
