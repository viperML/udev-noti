#+TITLE: udev-noti

* About
This project aims to show desktop notifications when the user plugs in a new device or removes it. The implementation should not be complex with unnecesary features.

* Installation
- Copy udev-noti.sh to /usr/local/share/ and set execution permissions for root
- Copy udev-noti.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/

**  TODO Automated installation with makefile

*   Attribution
This project is heavily inspired by https://github.com/dimonomid/my-udev-notify, which I found too complex for this task.
